### WIP

## Windows Sandbox Starter Kit

Steps: 
- Download this to Documents\wssk
- Rename any .examples or create new ones to enable those installers
- To run just double click *.wsb to launch it
- Probably works

Notes: 
 - This is awful, don't judge. (It's slightly better now)

TODO: 
 - Create a log
 - Everything else

Shortcuts:
 - Gets placed on the desktop
 - The idea is to use them for ad-hoc installers or anything that may need to be done after the initial boot
 - Should always call the functions library to keep things tidy

Modes:
 - Modes are the Presets
 - Create a wsb and directory under modes with the same name.
 - Create a 'settings.psm1' in the mode directory with the packages you want.

I'll happily accept a Pull Request with changes or ideas, or new mode presets, etc.
